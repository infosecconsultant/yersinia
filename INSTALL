Systems supported
-----------------
Due to our lack of resources, we've only been able to test Yersinia in a few
different operating systems; so please, if you have any other system that is
not included in the list below, send us a mail :)

- OpenBSD 3.4 (note: upgrade your pcap libraries to at least 0.7.2)
- Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x
- Solaris 5.8 64bits SPARC.
- FreeBSD 5.2.1

Do you wanna port yersinia to other systems? Plz, tell us, but keep in mind 
that you *SHOULD* have the platform in order to test it 'cause we
don't have all posible platforms (Ebay rules, but we can't afford it).
